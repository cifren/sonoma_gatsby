Credit unions often struggle to give members a high level of support during the upgrading or conversion of banking systems. Many simply do not have the resources to manage the conversion and support members at the same time. Sonoma has assisted many credit unions by providing members with a comprehensive call-in support service during conversions.

We specialize in ensuring your membersâ€™ questions and concerns are addressed quickly, thereby reducing frustration and enhancing the customer experience. Some of the conversion issues we are adept at helping you manage include:

- New member number assignments
- New PAC assignments

Understanding your new statement format, including:

- New terminology
- Transaction fees and interest charges
