As banking becomes more automated, it brings tremendous freedom and accessibility to your members, while at the same time creating unique challenges. Encouraging members to do more of their banking online requires that you understand and address their concerns and questions in a timely manner, thus limiting frustration and even the fear of making mistakes. There is nothing more reassuring for members than knowing they can bank on their own time and access a live help-desk representative at any time of the day or night.
