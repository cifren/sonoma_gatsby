Sonomaâ€™s key strategic advantage is our virtual model. By utilizing the power of the Internet, and with the advent of modern communication and technologies, we are able to operate a geographically dispersed help desk in a highly secure and professional manner.

Sonoma has developed a highly flexible and scalable model for running a virtual technical support centre.  Our model ensures that we are available 24-hours-per-day, every day of the year.

Being virtual makes us immune to localized network communication failures as calls are simply routed to employees in unaffected areas -- even during large-scale outages such as brownouts or blackouts.

Furthermore, our virtual model allows us to attract and retain customer service specialists who possess the seniority, technical know-how and professionalism necessary to meet your unique application and service requirements.
