        LOST OR STOLEN DEBIT CARD
Sonoma provides a 24/7 call-in service to members who have lost or had their debit card stolen, thus ensuring immediate cancellation. This service will significantly reduce your risk of liability or loss, while giving your members peace of mind.

Our goal is to work with you to design a process that meets your credit union’s specific requirements. Using data you have provided Sonoma, our help-desk personnel will rapidly verify the caller’s identity, giving instant notification to the switch-system provider to disable the card.

An email is also sent to the branch allowing your own member services representative to follow-up.
